Vault Explorer is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that leverages frontmatter properties to help you explore and organize your vault files.

The goal of Vault Explorer is to solve three main problems:

1. How to easily filter by groups of frontmatter properties and other file data.
2. How to display frontmatter properties in meaningful visual layouts.
3. How to create a social media-like experience using just your personal data.

Vault Explorer is a work in progress. Please check the GitHub repository and documentation website regularly for updates.

## Network use

Vault Explorer is a privacy friendly plugin.

When you access the grid view, Vault Explorer will make requests to the URL's that you specify to display cover images. You may disable this behavior in the settings.

Besides cover image fetching, Vault Explorer does not make any network requests.

Vault Explorer does not include any client-side telemetry.
